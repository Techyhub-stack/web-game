# Dodge Blocks — small web game

This is a tiny vanilla JavaScript game where you move a player left and right to dodge falling blocks. It's intentionally minimal so you can extend it.

How to run

1. Open a terminal in this folder: `c:/Users/Admin/Desktop/web-game`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the dev server: `npm run start`

If `live-server` isn't available globally, the included devDependency will be used.

Files

- `index.html` — game UI and canvas
- `style.css` — minimal styling
- `game.js` — game logic
- `package.json` — scripts and dev deps

Next steps (ideas)
- Add touch support and mobile UI
- Persist high scores with localStorage
- Add sound effects
- Add levels and power-ups
